Highlight:
@apply Function Implementation:

Successfully integrated the @apply function in Tailwind CSS, allowing the consolidation of frequently used utility classes into reusable styles.
This optimization reduced repetitive code across the project, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable codebase.
The implementation not only enhanced the efficiency of the styling process but also ensured consistent design application throughout the project.
This experience showcased my ability to apply advanced Tailwind CSS features effectively, contributing to a polished and professional portfolio.
